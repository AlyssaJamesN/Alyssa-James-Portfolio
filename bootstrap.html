                  <p>Itergo (from Latin word Iter [from Itinera, meaning a route, journey, or trip], and the English word Go [move from one place to another]), is the Low Fidelity prototype for a mobile travel application, designed to both help create a vacation itinerary and make those plans into a reality!</p>
                  <p>This was my very first step into the UX process. The initial interviewing and affinity diagram were done with one other individual, as a team; after that, all of the work towards this project is my own.</p>

                <div class="problemStatement">When planning long vacations, creating an itinerary can be a long, drawn-out process. Between checking hotel availability, transportation, and making sure that you get to do all the fun activities on your to-do list, planning can take a lot of time, can be stressful and can require the use of several different resources to accomplish one thing.

                    <p>Our team decided to conduct 10 one-on-one, recorded, interviews in person and through zoom calls, as a way to get detailed answers with expressions and animated responses that we could take note of. Our research questions revolved around finding out what our interviewees liked to do on vacations, how they preferred to travel, what apps or websites and programs they used to prepare for their trips (i.e., purchase airline/train tickets, hotel bookings, signing up for activities). The goal was to further understand users of a potential product and to analyze pain points in the vacation planning process. Garnering this information allowed for the formulation of possible solutions to some of these problems, while remaining conscientious of the time that we were allotted to complete this assignment.</p>
                    <p>The main insights my partner and I gathered from these interviews were that there was a focus on being able to plan a vacation itinerary beforehand, knowing the overall price of the trip based on these plans, and feeling secure about lodging, transportation, and activities.</p>

I was also able to see and feel what it was like to truly begin to delve into using Figma. Further more, I was able to use this version to test and ensure the platform made sense, was straightforward, easy to use, and all around a product that would be used by the targeted audience. After testing this low fidelity version, I went on to create a slightly more updated (though still low fidelity) version, with a basic Android design attempt, in order to get the feel of how Itergo might begin to shape up.</p>

                        <p>After creating the initial low fidelity version of Itergo, I performed four guerilla user tests, targeting individuals who are known travelers. The tests used these following tasks to gain insight and feedback on the usability of the application concept:</p>

                        <p>Task 1: Login and Logout through the three available routes; a. Username and email, b. Google, c. Facebook.</p>

                        <p>Completion of this task will be noted when you, the tester, have been able to successfully navigate to the home screen and utilize the logout functionality for each individual login option.</p>

                        <p>Task 2: Sign up for an account, going through all of the steps presented to you to create a new account.</p>

                        <p>Completion of this task will, similarly, be noted when you are able to navigate to the home screen through this process.</p>

                        <p>Task 3: Create a trip itinerary through the "Plan a Trip" function</p>

                        <p>Completion of this task will be noted when you have successfully navigated to the itinerary screen
                        </p>

                        <p>Additionally, it would be beneficial to know if you, the tester, notice basic functionalities within the scope of the prototype presented to you that should be added or improved upon.</p>

                        <p>From this test, I gathered high priority corrections that needed to be made, such as: there were alignment issues that made the app seem inconsistent; users needed clear ways to return or go back to a previous screen; there was a need for a clear "Home" button; and there should be a way to restart or delete an itinerary plan.</p>

                        <p>This feedback prompted me to, not only make these changes for this project, but also prompted me to keep similar user needs in mind for future concepts.</p>

                        <p>Task 1: Login and Logout through the three available routes; a. Username and email, b. Google, c. Facebook.</p>

                        <p>Completion of this task will be noted when you, the tester, have been able to successfully navigate to the home screen and utilize the logout functionality for each individual login option.</p>

                        <p>Task 2: Sign up for an account, going through all of the steps presented to you to create a new account.</p>

                        <p>Completion of this task will, similarly, be noted when you are able to navigate to the home screen through this process.</p>

                        <p>Task 3: Create a trip itinerary through the "Plan a Trip" function</p>

                        <p>Completion of this task will be noted when you have successfully navigated to the itinerary screen
                        </p>

                        <p>Additionally, it would be beneficial to know if you, the tester, notice basic functionalities within the scope of the prototype presented to you that should be added or improved upon.</p>

                        <p>From this test, I gathered high priority corrections that needed to be made, such as: there were alignment issues that made the app seem inconsistent; users needed clear ways to return or go back to a previous screen; there was a need for a clear "Home" button; and there should be a way to restart or delete an itinerary plan.</p>

                        <p>This feedback prompted me to, not only make these changes for this project, but also prompted me to keep similar user needs in mind for future concepts.</p>
